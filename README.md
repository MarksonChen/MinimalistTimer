## Why Minimalist Timer?

If you have ever tried to record the time spent on every work or study task as part of your daily workflow, you will soon find it tedious switching from/to mobile/web Timer apps every single time. Only if there is an app that can float on the screen, half-transparent and unintrusive, with all actions completable with just a single click -- how fantastic will that be!

Thus, I wrote this simple application three years ago, and it has become an integral part of my workflow for the past three years. I would record the time I spent on each work/study task and add them up at the end of the day. This provides me with quantitative metrics for measuring "productiveness", making myself feel accomplished -- or the contrary. Either way, it encourages me to maintain any positive habits and get rid of any unproductive ones. 

A timer app that is minimalistically simple would eliminate most "friction" in tracking your task time usage. If you are considering adopting a habit like this, I highly recommend you give this app a try!
